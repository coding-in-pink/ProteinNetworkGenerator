Question|1
Tanimoto measures the similarity between the fingerprints (i.e. set of defined characteristics) of two molecules.
//
Question|2
Yes, the histogram of shared target drugs is shifted slightly to the right, i.e. ligand pairs with shared targets tend to have higher tanimoto coefficients. This suggests that ligand pairs that share targets have more biological/chemical traits in common than ligand pairs that do not share targets.
//
Question|3
Instead of drug fingerprints, we could use 3-D alignment algorithms adapted for molecules, or use algorithms such as FEATURE to

Question|4f
Value|2.0
//
Question|5a
Yes, the predicted structure of diacylglycerol kinase alpha isoforms X1 and X4 are listed.
//
Question|5b
Yes, because similar structured/sequenced proteins are more likely to share targets and DHFR shares similarities with all the listed proteins, it is likely that other human proteins bind some of the same ligands as DHFR.
//
Question|6
No, because the other two drugs (F2,TYMS) are not listed in the significant results (although TYMS would be the most likely, as the E-value/scores were comparable to those listed in the results).

Question|7a
Value|0.198

Question|7b

Question|8a
DHFR,F2
//
Question|8b
F2,TYMS
//
Question|8c
DHFR,TYMS
//
Question|8d
DHFR & F2 are most likely to have the same drug targets while TYMS & F2 are less likely and DHFR & TYMS are not likely at all to have the same drug targets.
//
Question|9a
Highly connected means that the protein node had a low p-value with many other protein nodes, i.e. shares significantly similar target ligands (or characteristics of target ligands) with many of the proteins in its network
//
Question|9b
Biochemically, it means that these proteins are also structurally or functionally similar to many of the proteins in its network.
//
Question|10a
Yes, there seems to be significant inter-connections for sets of proteins that share an indication.
//
Question|10b
A node might be connected to others with different indications if 1) the node actually has multiple indicators including that one, or 2) the node shares a functional/structural role with the other nodes that is common in multiple pathways/conditions that arise to different indications.
